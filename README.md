# CodePortfolio
The above examples are C# scripts from my most recent game project called "Far Fetched" you can see some video footage here: https://www.fataliencat.com/games

I hope this gives you an idea of the coding experience I have obtain from working at Fin Design and Effects, from publishing Smash Crates and working on Far Fetched and other 48hr game jams. 

If you are interest in playing any of the games these are from you can find links on my website at: https://www.fataliencat.com/games

Thanks for taking the time to read my code.

Cheers, 
Julian
